# Repository Operating Rules for Codex

This repository is part of the Coregentis MPLP / Cognitive OS / SoloCrew / Validation Lab project family. Codex work here must preserve project boundaries and produce verifiable engineering evidence.

## Repository Layer

Validation Lab owns run packs, rulesets, evidence records, deterministic adjudication, pointer resolution, failure cases, and public validation UI. It may present reproducible evidence and failure analysis, but it must remain projection-only and runner/source-of-truth disciplined. It must not fabricate evidence, host unsupported evidence, or claim certification authority, endorsement authority, regulator approval, or legal-compliance proof.

## Repo Truth First

Before implementation, inspect repository truth:

- `git branch --show-current`
- `git status --short`
- `git rev-parse HEAD`
- `git rev-parse --verify origin/main || true`
- `git log --oneline -5`

Reuse existing assets before creating new files. Prefer updating an existing rule, skill, script, audit, or governance record over creating a duplicate document.

## Codex Skill Discovery

- `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md` is the repository-scoped Codex skill discovery path.
- `.codex/skills/*/SKILL.md` is retained as the project-internal ops source and compatibility copy.
- Keep mirrored skills same-named and content-equivalent; do not create divergent SOPs.

## Hard Boundaries

- Preserve protocol, runtime, product, validation, and publication boundaries.
- Normal task-authorized changes may modify files within the explicitly scoped repository layer, including low-risk code or docs that the current task asks for.
- Owner approval is required for high-risk or irreversible changes, including release mutation, registry mutation, public legal/compliance claims, package version changes, schema primitive intake, provider-send behavior, auth/payment/data-deletion flows, runtime authority changes, and merge/tag/seal actions.
- Do not run `npm publish`, `npm deprecate`, npm dist-tag mutation, PyPI upload, PyPI yank/delete, `git tag`, release seal creation, package version bump, or protocol schema primitive intake without an explicit owner-approved wave.
- Do not make public certification, regulator-approval, vendor-ranking, official-standard, or legal-compliance proof claims without owner approval.

## MPLP Schema v2 Discipline

For MPLP `schemas/v2` work, use this order:

1. Invariant first.
2. Negative fixture second.
3. Object schema third.
4. Positive fixture fourth.
5. Validator and conformance gates last.

v1.0 module references to v2 objects must be pointer-only. Do not inline v2 object fields into v1 module schemas.

## Boundary Language

- No product, runtime, commercial, certification, legal-compliance, regulator-approval, or vendor-ranking language may leak into MPLP protocol core.
- No protocol authority may leak into product UI.
- Cognitive OS may bind to MPLP semantics but must not redefine MPLP protocol authority.
- Validation Lab may present deterministic evidence and adjudication but must not become a certification authority.
- SoloCrew UI must not expose internal protocol/runtime jargon as primary user-facing copy.

## Standard Subagent Lanes

Use `.codex/agents/*.toml` reviewers only when the parent task explicitly requests them. Relevant lanes include `package_surface_auditor`, `release_governance_reviewer`, `protocol_schema_reviewer`, `product_boundary_reviewer`, `runtime_binding_reviewer`, and `publication_claim_reviewer`.

Default lane policy: use no subagent for trivial docs typos, one subagent for isolated repo-specific review, and multiple subagents for release, schema, runtime, publication, or cross-repo tasks. MPLP-Validation-Lab defaults to `release_governance_reviewer`, with `publication_claim_reviewer` and `protocol_schema_reviewer` as secondary lanes when the task touches public evidence claims, pointer resolution, rulesets, or conformance semantics.

Subagents run review lanes only unless edits are explicitly authorized. They inherit sandbox and approval boundaries, must not publish, upload, tag, seal, bump versions, mutate registries, intake schema primitives, merge PRs, or change public claims, and must return P0/P1/P2 findings to the parent with files inspected and commands run.

## Completion Discipline

Do not declare completion without reporting:

- files changed
- commands run
- pass/fail evidence
- final git status
- remaining risk

If a verification command is unavailable or inappropriate, state why instead of silently skipping it.
