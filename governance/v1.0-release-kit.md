# MPLP Validation Lab v1.0 Release Kit

This kit contains the authoritative narratives, protocols, and templates for the v1.0 institutional release.

---

## 1. Official Release Announcement
**Hero Line**: *Validation Lab v1.0 is released and frozen: a stationary, machine-verifiable evidence gateway for institutional audit—non-certifying, vendor-neutral, reproducible.*

### Announcement Narrative
*   **What shipped**: v1.0 delivers a closed-loop Route A audit path with cryptographic anchoring (`lab-manifest.json` + `SEAL-v0.17.0`) and real-time publication integrity gates (`gate-status.json`). The lab is now **STATIONARY** and maintenance-only.
*   **What it is not**: This is not certification, ranking, or endorsement of any vendor, substrate, framework, or agent intelligence. All conclusions are strictly based on machine-verifiable evidence packs.
*   **How to verify**: External auditors can reproduce integrity checks via the published Institutional Anchors and the frozen Seal/Manifest chain; Website and Docs only deep-link and explain navigation—no secondary hashing or repackaging.

### Institutional Value (v1.0 Matrix)
*   **Depth**: Dispute-level FAIL benchmark is forensic-closed and bit-identical.
*   **Breadth**: Cross-substrate yardstick resolves evidence pointers deterministically across substrates.
*   **Explainability**: Ruleset evolution is explainable with zero verdict flips and machine-verifiable DiffPack.

## 2. External Citation Contract (v1.0)
Guidelines for third-party use and citation of Validation Lab v1.0 results.

*   **Authoritative Anchors**: `lab-manifest.json` + `SEAL-v0.17.0.md` are the sole authoritative sources for hashes and institutional anchors.
*   **Allowed Claims** (Safe):
    *   “Publication / Institutional Integrity is PASS under v1.0 gates.”
    *   “Evidence packs are machine-verifiable and pointer-closed.”
    *   “Ruleset evolution is explainable and audited for zero flip in curated sets.”
:::warning Non-Certification Boundary
*   **Prohibited Claims** (Must-not):
    *   Any statement implying certification, compliance attestation, vendor endorsement, or performance ranking.
    *   Any claim that a substrate “conforms” in a regulatory sense, unless explicitly framed as informative-only and bounded by evidence scope.
:::
*   **Verification Procedure**:
    *   **Step 1**: Verify SEAL hash → manifest entries.
    *   **Step 2**: Verify `gate-status.json` artifact hash (publication integrity).
    *   **Step 3**: Resolve pointers via `canonptr:v1` / evidence pointer rules.

## 3. Maintenance Patch Protocol (SOP)
Standard procedure for v1.0 maintenance period (Documentation Hygiene only).

### PR Template Fields
*   **Patch Type**: `SECURITY` | `DOC_HYGIENE` | `LINK_FIX` | `BUILD_BREAK_FIX`
*   **Affected Areas**: `UI copy` | `nav` | `docs projection` | `dependency bump`
*   **Non-Goals**: NO ruleset change | NO adjudication logic change | NO evidence pack change | NO manifest/seal change.
*   **Required Proof**:
    *   `VLAB-GATE-FREEZE: PASS`
    *   `Pointer integrity gate: PASS`
    *   `No-byte-diff assertion` for frozen assets (line endings / sort / formatting).

## 4. Institutional FAQ (v1.0-Informative)
*   **Q: Does v1.0 certify my AI agent?**
    *   **A**: No. It validates the **Institutional Integrity** of the evidence provided.
*   **Q: Why is the Lab stationary?**
    *   **A**: To provide a fixed, audit-grade baseline that does not drift during evaluation.
*   **Q: Where is the Source of Truth?**
    *   **A**: The Repository (schemas/governance/seals). The Lab is a derived projection for adjudication.

## 6. How to Verify: 3-Step Recipe
1.  **Clone** the repository and check out tag `v1.0.0-final`.
2.  **Verify** the Master SEAL hash: `npx tsx scripts/gates/gate-v0.17.0-freeze.ts`.
3.  **Audit** the `lab-manifest.json` anchors against the live UI at `lab.mplp.io/validation`.
