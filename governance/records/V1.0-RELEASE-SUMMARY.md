# Validation Lab v1.0: Institutional Release Summary

**Version**: v1.0.0 (STATIONARY)
**Release Series**: v0.17 Finality
**Status**: Institutional Freeze / Maintenance

## 1. Objective
The MPLP Validation Lab v1.0 provides a machine-verifiable, substrate-neutral environment for adjudicating agentic behavior based on bit-identical evidence packs. This release signifies the completion of the core technical proof-of-work (Isolation, Depth, Breadth, and Explainability).

## 2. Institutional Boundaries
To ensure objectivity and vendor-neutrality, the Lab operates under strict constitutional boundaries:
- **Non-Certification**: The Lab does not issue certifications or rankings. It adjudicates evidence status (`PASS/FAIL`) against specific semantic rulesets.
- **Non-Endorsement**: Adjudication results are purely forensic and do not imply endorsement of any model or substrate provider.
- **Vendor Neutrality**: The Lab engine and rulesets are decoupled from substrate-specific implementations.

## 3. High-Security Entry Points
Institutional auditors can verify the v1.0 finality through the following entry points:

- **Master Record**: [lab-manifest.json](/_meta/lab-manifest.json)
