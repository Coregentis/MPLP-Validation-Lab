# Governance Directory

This directory contains **non-normative governance documentation** for operating the Validation Lab repository (process, seals, reports, registries, and templates). It does NOT define MPLP protocol requirements, and it MUST NOT be interpreted as certification or endorsement.

## Non-Endorsement Boundary

Governance documents describe **process and evidence closure** only. They MUST NOT rank, certify, endorse, or approve any framework, vendor, or substrate.

## Directory Index

- `seals/` — Capability / projection seals (evidence closure snapshots, non-normative)
  - Catalog: `governance/seals/README.md`
- `sop/` — Standard Operating Procedures (how changes must be executed and reported)
- `registry/` — Registry three-file set (routes, truth sources, gates)
- `projection/` — Projection SSOT and projection-related seals
- `reports/` — Audit reports and Task Completion Reports (filing structure + references)
- `templates/` — Templates used by governance and reporting workflows
