# Inventory SSOT Location

> [!NOTE]
> The repository-level inventory SSOT has been moved to `/inventory/`.

## Rationale

- `governance/` contains policies and contracts (normative governance)
- `inventory/` contains structural facts and asset registries (descriptive metadata)

This separation maintains semantic clarity.

## SSOT Documents

| Document | Location |
|:---|:---|
| Directory Constitution | `/inventory/REPO_SHAPE.md` |
| Asset Inventory | `/inventory/ASSET_INVENTORY.json` |
| Asset Catalog | `/inventory/ASSET_CATALOG.md` |
| Cross-Repo Dependencies | `/inventory/CROSS_REPO_DEPS.md` |
