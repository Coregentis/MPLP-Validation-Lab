# v0.13 Expansion Charter [Institutional]

## 1. Governance Context
The v0.13 series marks the first **Extension Line** beyond the `v0.12.1` Sustainability Baseline. It proves the Lab's ability to scale coverage and logic while maintaining strict auditability.

## 2. v0.13.0: Substrate Expansion (Primary)
- **Primary Dimension**: Substrate Expansion (`pydantic-ai`).
- **Target Scenario**: `d1-budget` (Budget Governance).
- **Hard Constraint**: ZERO changes to rulesets, IA categories, or scenario families.
- **Goal**: Ingest 4 representative samples (2 PASS, 2 FAIL) and register them in the curated SSOT.

## 3. v0.13.1: Ruleset Evolution (Secondary)
- **Primary Dimension**: Logic Evolution (Ruleset 1.2 -> 1.3).
- **Shadow Input Anchor**: `v0.12.1-institution` locked sample set.
- **Drift Attribution**: Ruleset changes must be adjudicated against the locked anchor to isolate logic-induced deltas from coverage-induced deltas.

## 4. Expansion-Scope Gate (Guardrail)
The `audit:expansion-scope` gate must enforce:
1. Byte-identical preservation of the `v0.12.1` stationary anchors.
2. One-dimensional change per release (v0.13.0 = Samples only; v0.13.1 = Logic only).
