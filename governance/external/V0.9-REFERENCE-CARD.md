# V0.9 Reference Card — MPLP Validation Lab (v0.9.0–v0.9.1)

**Positioning (one sentence)**  
v0.9.0–v0.9.1 upgrades ruleset diff from "generatable" to "explainable + reproducible + referenceable" while preserving the v0.8 frozen evidence chain.

## Evidence Chain (Sealed)
PROJECTION-SEAL.v0.7.2  
→ CAPABILITY-SEAL.v0.8.0  
→ DIFF-ENHANCEMENT-SEAL.v0.9.0  
→ UI-FACETS-REPROPACK-SEAL.v0.9.1

## Key Entry Points
- Ruleset Diff UI: `/rulesets/diff`
- v0.9.0 Seal: `governance/seals/DIFF-ENHANCEMENT-SEAL.v0.9.0.md`
- v0.9.1 Seal: `governance/seals/UI-FACETS-REPROPACK-SEAL.v0.9.1.md`

## Non-Endorsement / Non-Certification Boundary
This project does not certify, endorse, rank, or score any framework/vendor/substrate.  
Ruleset diff reports explain ruleset changes only — not framework quality.

## Reproducibility
- Enhanced diffs: `export/ruleset-diff/*/diff.enhanced.json`
- Repro packs: `export/ruleset-diff/*/repro-pack.json`
- v0.8 frozen baseline remains immutable and is protected by CI.
