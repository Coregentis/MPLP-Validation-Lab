# Templates

This directory contains reusable templates for governance and reporting.

## Non-Normative Boundary

Templates are operational scaffolding. They do NOT define protocol requirements and MUST NOT be interpreted as certification or endorsement language.

## Available Templates

Common templates include (actual filenames must match repository):

- Task Completion Report template
  - Example: `TASK-COMPLETION-REPORT-TEMPLATE.md`

## Usage

1) Copy a template into the appropriate reports directory (e.g., `governance/reports/task-completion/`)
2) Fill required fields:
   - Task ID / date / scope
   - Files changed
   - Gate results
   - Hash anchors (if applicable)
3) Ensure wording remains pointer-first and avoids forbidden language
