# Dormancy Notice [v0.12.1]

**Status**: Institutional Baseline (Locked)
**Effective Date**: 2026-01-25
**Scope**: v0.12.x Sustainability Series

## 1. Institutional Purpose
The Validation Lab v0.12.1 represents the **Sustainability Stopline**. It is preserved as a stable, auditable, and reproducible reference for Multi-Agent Lifecycle Protocol (MPLP) evidence.

## 2. Dormancy Rules
During the dormancy phase, the following rules apply:
- **No Behavioral Drift**: No changes to interpretive logic, projection schemas, or verdict weighting.
- **Maintenance Only**: Permitted changes are limited to security patches, dependency logic fixes (without semantic shift), and gate parity repairs.
- **Reference Stability**: The [v0.12.1 SEAL](file:///Users/jasonwang/Documents/AI_Dev/V1.0_release/Validation_Lab/governance/seals/SEAL-v0.12.1.md) is the immutable anchor for this series.

## 3. Operations
- **Monthly Heartbeat**: Verification of gate pass and structural integrity.
- **Audit Access**: The lab remains fully functional for evidence review and local replication.
