# Reports

This directory contains **non-normative governance reports** used to document work completion, audits, and verification evidence.

## Non-Endorsement Boundary

Reports document repository process and evidence closure only. They do NOT certify, endorse, or rank any framework/vendor/substrate.

## Structure

Common subdirectories:

- `task-completion/` — Task Completion Reports (required by SOP for operational changes)
- `audits/` — Audit reports (e.g., doc association audits)

(Actual subdirectory names must match repository structure.)

## Filing Rules (Pointer-First)

A report SHOULD:

- Identify the task id + scope
- List files changed
- Record gate results (PASS/FAIL) with commands
- Record hashes for key artifacts (when applicable)
- Link to seals or related documents when relevant
- Avoid evaluative language (no certification/endorsement/ranking)

## Templates

Templates live in:
- `governance/templates/`

See:
- `governance/templates/README.md`
