## 3. Evidence Pointer De-reference (Build-Time Sampling)
Testing the de-resolution of `mplp://` pointers within the production asset bundle.

| Sample Run ID | Pointer | Resolved Value (Abstract) | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `mcp-d1-real-runner-det-001` | `mplp://manifest/env_ref/image_digest` | `sha256:1acf862e...` | ✅ PASS |
| `mcp-d1-synthetic-001` | `mplp://manifest/hashes/canonical_pack_root_hash` | `e056417ca1...` | ✅ PASS |
| `crewai-d1-real-runner-det-001` | `mplp://timeline/events.ndjson` | `Verified NDJSON Sample` | ✅ PASS |

## 4. Maintenance Freeze Declaration
- [x] **Maintenance Policy**: Any addition of runs or ruleset changes MUST trigger a manifest version bump and a new RC seal.
- [x] **Audit Traceability**: This record is now the baseline for any future drift detection.
