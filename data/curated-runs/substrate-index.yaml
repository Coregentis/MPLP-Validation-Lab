# Status Taxonomy
# =============================================================================
#
# REGISTERED: Run is in allowlist, pack exists but not adjudicated
# EVIDENCE_READY: Pack is closure-complete with pack_root_hash
# ADJUDICATED: verdict.json exists with verdict_hash
# NOT_ADMISSIBLE: Failed admission gates (structural/schema issues)
# NOT_EVALUATED: Deliberately not evaluated (out of scope)
