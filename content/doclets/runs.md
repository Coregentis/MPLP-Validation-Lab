## How to read a run
Each run displays source, tier, verdict, and available evidence surfaces.
If an item is missing in **{{run_inventory.v1_count}}** V1 or **{{run_inventory.v2_count}}** V2 runs, that is an evidence signal — not a UI error.

## Evidence surfaces
Surfaces represent *which artifacts are present* (plan/confirm/trace/snapshots etc.).
Use “View JSON” only to inspect the raw pack behind the run.
