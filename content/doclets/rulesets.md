## What rulesets mean here
Rulesets are the adjudication clauses used to evaluate evidence packs.
They are versioned (Current Default: **{{ruleset_inventory.current_default}}**) and displayed as data, but explained here as reading guidance.

## How to compare versions
Prefer newer rulesets only when the scope explicitly calls for it.
Version selection must be tied to the evidence pack manifest.
