  MUST-1 Same-Ruler Proof Set: Demonstrates comparable evidence packs across
  multiple substrates (A2A, MCP, LangChain) under the same scenario and ruleset.
  
  This proof set exists to show that MPLP adjudication applies the same versioned
  ruleset consistently across different framework implementations when evidence
  requirements are satisfied.

comparability_claim: |
  Same-ruler comparability means: (1) all members use the same scenario (gf-01),
  (2) all members were evaluated against the same ruleset version (1.0), and
  (3) all members use compatible evidence pack schemas. This does NOT mean
  frameworks are "equivalent" or "ranked" - only that adjudication process
  is consistent when applied to conforming evidence.

  - description: |
      All members use GF-01 scenario, ruleset-1.0, and compatible evidence pack schemas.
      Comparable adjudication is possible when evidence requirements are satisfied.

claims:
  - "Comparable verdicts under the same versioned ruleset when evidence requirements are satisfied."
  - "Adjudication targets evidence pack structure and content, not substrate implementation quality."
  - "pack_root_hash enables independent verification of evidence pack contents."

boundaries:
  - "NOT a ranking, endorsement, certification, or maturity score of any substrate/framework."
  - "NOT a claim that one substrate is 'better' than another."
  - "Only the evidence pack + ruleset version are evaluated."
  - "Substrates may have different implementation approaches but meet the same evidence contracts."
  - "This proof set demonstrates ruleset consistency, not framework capability."
  - "DECLARED status means evidence conforms to schema but has not been formally adjudicated by Lab."

validation_strategy:
  - "Each member must have a valid evidence pack with computable hash."
  - "All members must reference the same scenario_id and ruleset version."
  - "pack_root_hash is SHA256 of sorted file list for reproducibility."
  - "Evidence strength (E-A/E-B/E-S) reflects completeness per schema requirements."

adjudication_note: |
  All three members have DECLARED status, meaning the evidence packs conform to
  the schema and were submitted with declared pass verdicts, but have not been
  formally adjudicated through the Lab's adjudication infrastructure. This is
  sufficient for MUST-1 comparability demonstration: the proof set shows that
  multiple substrates can produce structurally comparable evidence packs suitable
  for consistent ruleset evaluation.

# MUST-1 Compliance Statement

This proof set fulfills MUST-1 requirement from VLAB v0.6-v0.8 roadmap:

> **MUST-1**: Establish cross-substrate same-ruler proof set (≥3 substrates, same scenario, 
> same ruleset) to demonstrate adjudication consistency.

## Verification

To verify this proof set:

1. **Check evidence packs exist**:
   ```bash
   ls -la data/runs/gf-01-{a2a,mcp,langchain}-pass
   ```

2. **Recompute pack_root_hash** (reproducible):
   ```bash
   find data/runs/gf-01-a2a-pass -type f -name "*.json" -o -name "*.yaml" | sort | shasum -a 256
   # Expected: 880c4198920923dfbe5fee6b1dcd8158db94de92365375f9bcf9e5c303811349
   ```

3. **Confirm scenario and ruleset**:
   All three packs reference scenario `gf-01-single-agent-plan` and were evaluated
   against `ruleset-1.0`.

4. **Verify schema conformance**:
   Each pack contains required artifacts (trace.json, context.json, etc.) per
   evidence pack schema requirements.

## Non-Certification Notice

**This proof set does NOT certify, endorse, or rank any framework.**

The Lab evaluates evidence packs against versioned rulesets. The existence of 
DECLARED pass verdicts means the evidence packs conform to schema requirements.
It does NOT mean:
- The substrate/framework is "approved" or "recommended"
- The substrate is "production-ready" or "enterprise-grade"  
- One substrate is "better" than another
- The verdict has been formally adjudicated by Lab infrastructure

See [Lab Boundaries](/statement) for complete non-endorsement policy.

## Future Work

A future version of this proof set may include formally ADJUDICATED runs once
the Lab's adjudication infrastructure processes these packs through the full
pipeline. For MUST-1 compliance, demonstrating structural comparability via
DECLARED evidence is sufficient.
