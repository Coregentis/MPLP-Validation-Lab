# Test Vectors v0.5
# 
# Public, standardized test vectors for MPLP Protocol adjudication.
# Each vector is a complete evidence pack that can be:
#   1. Adjudicated by ruleset-1.2
#   2. Shadow-validated for parity
#   3. Signed and verified
#
# Coverage Target: ≥5 PASS + ≥5 FAIL per domain (D1-D4)

  v0.5 Test Vectors provide a standardized, publicly-verifiable set of
  evidence packs for third-party validation. Any party can:
  - Download vectors and verify independently
  - Generate signed proofs using the public verifier CLI
  - Compare their adjudication results with Lab baseline
